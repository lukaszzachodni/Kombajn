# Layering

## Layering elements in a scene or movie

In JSON2Video, the order of elements within the `elements` array of a `scene` or `movie` dictates their layering. Elements listed later in the array are rendered on top of those listed earlier. This behavior mirrors the stacking context in HTML and CSS.

### Elements array order

The elements array order is the primary method for controlling layering. Elements listed later in the array are rendered on top of those listed earlier.

**Key Points:**

* The first element in the array is the bottom-most layer.
* Each subsequent element is placed above the previous one.
* The last element in the array is the top-most layer and will obscure any overlapping elements beneath it.

**Example**

Consider the following JSON snippet:

```json
{
  "scenes": [
    {
      "duration": 10,
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "image",
          "src": "background.jpg",
          "x": 0,
          "y": 0,
          "width": 1920,
          "height": 1080
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Hello World"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the image specified by `background.jpg` will be the background layer. The text "Hello World" will be rendered on top of the image.

**Overlapping Elements:**

If elements have overlapping coordinate spaces, the element with the higher stacking order will visually cover the element(s) below it.

### Controlling Layering with z-index

While the order in the `elements` array is the primary method for controlling layering, you can use the `z-index` property for more explicit control. The `z-index` property allows you to define the stacking order within a range of -99 to 99. Elements with higher `z-index` values are rendered on top of elements with lower values.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "scenes": [
    {
      "duration": 10,
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Hello World",
          "z-index": 1
        },
        {
          "type": "image",
          "src": "background.jpg",
          "z-index": -1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the text continues to be rendered on top of the image, even though it's listed earlier in the `elements` array because the `z-index` of the text is set to 1 and the `z-index` of the image is set to -1.

## Transparent scenes with video backgrounds

By default, the elements in the Movie `elements` array are layered over the scenes. This is helpful for adding a logo, a watermark, or any other element on top of all scenes.

**But what if you want the scenes to have a transparent background and show a video background?**

You can achieve this by setting the `background-color` property of the `scene` objects to `transparent` and adding a video element to the `elements` array with a `z-index` lower than 0. Scenes always have a `z-index` of 0, so the video will be rendered behind the scenes.

**Example**

```json
{
  "scenes": [
    {
      "comment": "Scene 1",
      "background-color": "transparent",
      "duration": 5,
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "This is scene 1"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "comment": "Scene 2",
      "background-color": "transparent",
      "duration": 5,
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "This is scene 2"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "video",
      "src": "https://cdn.json2video.com/assets/videos/beach-04.mp4",
      "z-index": -1
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the scenes have a transparent background and the video is shown through the transparent background of the scenes.
The video is set to have a `z-index` of -1, which means it will be rendered behind the scenes.
