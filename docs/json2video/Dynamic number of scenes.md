# Dynamic number of scenes

Sometimes it's necessary to create a video where the number of scenes is not fixed but determined dynamically based on data. For example, you might want to create a slideshow where the number of images and their associated durations are defined in a data source. JSON2Video supports this through the `iterate` property within a scene definition.

## Using the iterate property

The `iterate` property allows you to repeat a scene definition for each item in an array specified in the `variables` section of the movie.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "comment": "Variable number of scenes example",
  "resolution": "full-hd",
  "variables": {
    "slides": [
      {
        "image_url": "https://example.com/image1.jpg",
        "duration": 5,
        "title": "Slide 1"
      },
      {
        "image_url": "https://example.com/image2.jpg",
        "duration": 3,
        "title": "Slide 2"
      },
      {
        "image_url": "https://example.com/image3.jpg",
        "duration": 7,
        "title": "Slide 3"
      }
    ]
  },
  "scenes": [
    {
      "iterate": "slides",
      "duration": "{{duration}}",
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "image",
          "src": "{{image_url}}"
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "{{title}}",
          "style": "005"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
