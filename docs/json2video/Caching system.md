# Caching system

JSON2Video is designed to optimize video rendering as much as possible and reduce waiting time. To achieve this, it utilizes a caching system to avoid redundant operations such as:

* Repeatedly downloading the same files.
* Re-rendering templates or scenes that haven't changed.

The system intelligently detects changes and rebuilds scenes or movies accordingly. However, you can manually control caching behavior using the `cache` property.

## Controlling Cache Behavior

The `cache` property can be applied to:

* **Movies:** Force a complete re-render of the entire movie.
* **Scenes:** Force a re-render of a specific scene.
* **Elements:** Force a re-render or re-download of a specific element.

To better understand how the caching system works, let's see a few cases:

* Forcing a re-render of the scene does not force the re-render or re-download of the elements in that scene, it only rebuilds the scene using the cached elements.
* Forcing a re-render of an element inside a scene automatically triggers a re-render of the scene, but the other elements in the scene may still be cached.

## Using the cache property

Set the `cache` property to `false` to force a fresh render, bypassing the cache. Setting it to `true` (or omitting the property) enables the system to use a cached version if available.

**Example: Forcing a Re-render of an Element**

```json
{
    "type": "[[ELEMENT_TYPE]]",
    "cache": false
}
```
