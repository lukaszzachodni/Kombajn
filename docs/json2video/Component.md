# Component

**Type:** object

Creates an element with animation to be rendered in the movie or scene. The `component` property specifies the ID of the component to use from the available library of available components, and the `settings` property allows you to customize the component's appearance and behavior. The component library includes a variety of pre-defined components, such as shape animations, animated text boxes, lower-thirds, and more.

## Properties

The following properties are required:
* `component`
* `type`

### cache
If `true`, the system will attempt to retrieve and use a previously rendered (cached) version of this element, if an identical version is available. This can significantly reduce processing time. If `false`, a new render of the element will always be performed, regardless of whether a cached version exists. The default value is `true`.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | boolean |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `true` |
| **Format** | boolean |

### chroma-key
Allows you to define a color or a range of colors within the element that will be rendered as transparent. This effect is commonly known as chroma keying or 'green screen'. The `color` property specifies the base color to be made transparent, while the optional `tolerance` property adjusts the sensitivity of the transparency, allowing you to define a range of similar colors to also be included in the transparency effect.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | object |
| **Required** | No |

This object contains the following properties:
- **color**: (string, required) - Set the color for which alpha will be set to 0 (full transparency)
    - Example: `#00b140`
- **tolerance**: (integer, optional) - Makes the selection more or less sensitive to changes in color. A value of 1 will select only the provided color. A value of 100 will select all colors, so the full canvas
    - Default: 25
    - Minimum: 1
    - Maximum: 100

### comment
A field for adding descriptive notes or internal memos related to the element. This comment is for your reference and does not affect the rendering process. It can be used to keep notes about the element like describing the content or the purpose of the element.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | string |
| **Required** | No |

### component
The ID of the pre-defined component to use. This ID references a component from the component library. Use the component picker control in the editor to find available components, or refer to the library documentation for a comprehensive list of available component IDs.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | string |
| **Required** | Yes |

### condition
A string containing an expression that determines whether the element will be rendered. The element is rendered only if the condition evaluates to true. If the condition is false or an empty string, the element will be skipped and not included in the scene or movie.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | string |
| **Required** | No |

### correction
Defines image and video correction settings, allowing you to adjust the visual characteristics of the element. This includes properties for adjusting contrast, brightness, saturation, and gamma, enabling fine-tuning of the element's appearance. Values in the edge of the range may result in the element being irrecognizable.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | object |
| **Required** | No |

This object contains the following properties:
- **brightness**: (number, optional) - Adjust the brightness
    - Default: 0
    - Minimum: -1
    - Maximum: 1
- **contrast**: (number, optional) - Adjust the contrast
    - Default: 1

- **saturation**: (number, optional) - Adjust the saturation
    - Default: 1
    - Minimum: 0
    - Maximum: 3

### crop
Defines the cropping area of the element. It allows you to specify a rectangular region of the element to display, effectively cropping the external parts of the provided area. The `x` and `y` properties define the top-left corner of the cropping rectangle, while the `width` and `height` properties determine the dimensions of the cropped area.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | object |
| **Required** | No |

This object contains the following properties:
- **height**: (integer, required) - Sets the height of the cropping area
- **width**: (integer, required) - Sets the width of the cropping area
- **x**: (integer, optional) - Sets the left point of cropping
    - Default: 0
- **y**: (integer, optional) - Sets the top point of cropping
    - Default: 0

### duration
Defines the duration of the element in seconds. Use a positive value to specify the exact duration. A value of -1 tells the system to automatically calculate the duration based on the intrinsic length of the element's asset (e.g., video or audio file). A value of -2 sets the element's duration to match that of its parent scene (if the element is within a scene) or the entire movie (if the element is in the movie's top-level elements array).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | number |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `-2` |
| **Format** | float |
| **Minimum Value** | -2 |

### extra-time
The amount of time, in seconds, to extend the element's duration beyond its natural length. This allows the element to linger on screen after its content has finished playing or displaying. For example, setting `extra-time` to 0.5 will keep the element visible for an additional half-second.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | number |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `0` |
| **Format** | float |

### fade-in
The duration, in seconds, of the fade-in effect applied to the element's appearance. A value of `0` means no fade-in effect. Larger values result in a longer fade-in duration. The value must be a non-negative number.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | number |
| **Required** | No |
| **Format** | float |
| **Minimum Value** | 0 |

### fade-out
The duration, in seconds, of the fade-out effect applied to the element's disappearance. A value of `0` means no fade-out effect. Larger values result in a longer fade-out duration. The value must be a non-negative number.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | number |
| **Required** | No |
| **Format** | float |
| **Minimum Value** | 0 |

### flip-horizontal
If `true`, the element will be flipped horizontally, creating a mirror image effect. The default value is `false`.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | boolean |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `false` |

### flip-vertical
If `true`, the element will be flipped vertically, creating an upside-down image. The default value is `false`.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | boolean |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `false` |

### height
Sets the height of the element in pixels, scaling the element up or down as needed to fit the specified height. A value of -1 maintains the element's original aspect ratio when resizing based on the width property. If 'resize' is set, the 'height' property is ignored. The minimum accepted value is -1.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | integer |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `-1` |
| **Minimum Value** | -1 |

### id
A unique identifier for the element within the movie. This string allows you to reference and manage individual elements. If not provided, the system will automatically generate a random string.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | string |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `@randomString` |

### mask
URL to a PNG or video file that defines a mask, controlling the transparency of the element. The mask uses a grayscale color scheme: black areas render the element fully transparent, white areas render it fully opaque, and shades of gray create varying levels of partial transparency. This allows you to create complex shapes and effects by selectively hiding portions of the element.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | string |
| **Required** | No |

### pan
Specifies the direction to pan the element within its container. Valid values are `left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and their combinations like `top-left`. If the `zoom` property is also specified, the pan will occur while zooming. If `zoom` is not specified, the element will pan without zooming.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | string |
| **Required** | No |
| **Enum Values** | `left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right` |

### pan-crop
When panning an element, this boolean property determines whether the element is stretched and cropped to fill the movie canvas. If set to `true` (default), the element will be stretched and cropped during panning. If set to `false`, the element will not be stretched and potentially leave empty space within the movie canvas. Example: if `pan-crop` is set to `false` and the movie canvas and element have the same size, panning the element to the left may leave a black bar on the right side of the movie canvas as the element moves to the left. If `pan-crop` is set to `true` (default), the element will be stretched and cropped during panning, so the element will effectively fill the movie canvas.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | boolean |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `true` |

### pan-distance
Defines the distance the element pans within its container when the `pan` property is specified. This value, expressed as a floating-point number, determines the amount of movement during the panning effect. Higher values result in faster and more pronounced panning. The allowed range is from 0.01 to 0.5, with a default value of 0.1.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | number |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `0.1` |
| **Format** | float |
| **Minimum Value** | 0.01 |
| **Maximum Value** | 0.5 |

### position
Specifies the position of the element within the movie canvas. Choose from predefined positions like 'top-left', 'top-right', 'bottom-right', 'bottom-left', and 'center-center' to quickly place the element. Selecting 'custom' enables precise positioning using the `x` and `y` properties to define the element's horizontal and vertical coordinates.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | string |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `custom` |
| **Enum Values** | `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-right`, `bottom-left`, `center-center`, `custom` |

### resize
Defines how the element should be resized to fit within the movie canvas. The values `cover` and `fill` stretch the element to completely cover the movie canvas, potentially cropping parts of the element. The values `fit` and `contain` ensure the entire element is visible, potentially leaving empty space within the canvas. When `resize` is set, the `width` and `height` properties are ignored, as the element's size is determined by the chosen resize mode. The value `cover`is a synonym for `fill` and `contain`is a synonym for `fit`.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | string |
| **Required** | No |
| **Enum Values** | `cover`, `fill`, `fit`, `contain` |

### rotate
Defines the rotation properties of the element. It allows you to specify the angle of rotation and the time it takes to complete the rotation, enabling animated rotation effects.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | object |
| **Required** | No |

This object contains the following properties:
- **angle**: (number, required) - Sets the angle of rotation
    - Default: 0
    - Minimum: -360
    - Maximum: 360
- **speed**: (number, optional) - Sets the time it takes to rotate the provided angle. A zero value means no movement
    - Default: 0
    - Minimum: 0

### settings
Settings to customize the component's appearance and behavior. The available settings depend on the selected component; refer to the component library documentation for details. This allows you to tailor pre-built components to fit your specific video needs.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | object |
| **Required** | No |

### start
The element's start time, in seconds, determines when it begins playing within its container's timeline. This time is relative to the beginning of the scene it's in or, if the element is part of the movie's elements array, relative to the beginning of the movie itself. The default value is 0, meaning the element starts at the beginning of its container's timeline.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | number |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `0` |
| **Format** | float |

### type
This field specifies the element's type and must be set to `component` for component elements.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | string |
| **Required** | Yes |
| **Enum Values** | `component` |

### variables
Defines local variables specific to this element. These variables can be used to dynamically alter the element's properties or content during the rendering process. Variable names must consist of only letters, numbers, and underscores.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | object |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `{}` |

### width
Sets the width of the element in pixels. The element will be scaled up or down to fit the specified width. A value of -1 instructs the system to maintain the element's original aspect ratio when resizing based on the height property. If 'resize' is set, the 'width' property is ignored. The minimum accepted value is -1.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | integer |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `-1` |
| **Minimum Value** | -1 |

### x
The horizontal position of the element within the movie canvas, measured in pixels. This property is only applicable when the `position` property is set to `custom`. A value of `0` places the element at the left edge of the movie canvas. Higher integer values move the element to the right.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | number |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `0` |
| **Format** | integer |

### y
Sets the vertical position of the element within the movie canvas, measured in pixels. This property is only applicable when the `position` property is set to `custom`. A value of `0` places the element at the top edge of the movie canvas. Higher integer values move the element downwards.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | number |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `0` |
| **Format** | integer |

### z-index
Element's z-index, determining its stacking order within the video. Higher values bring the element to the front, obscuring elements with lower values. Lower values send the element to the back, potentially behind other elements. The value must be an integer between -99 and 99; the default is 0. The natural way of layering elements is by the order of the elements in the `elements` array. If by any reason this does not work in your case, you can use the `z-index` property to manually control the stacking order.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | number |
| **Required** | No |
| **Default Value** | `0` |
| **Format** | integer |
| **Minimum Value** | -99 |
| **Maximum Value** | 99 |

### zoom
Zooms the element by a specified percentage. Use positive values (1-10) to zoom in and negative values (-1 to -10) to zoom out. A value of 0 results in no zoom. Combine with the `pan` property to control the focal point during zooming.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | integer |
| **Required** | No |
| **Minimum Value** | -10 |
| **Maximum Value** | 10 |
